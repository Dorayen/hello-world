# hello-world
Starting point

#about me
everytime I start to learn a language I never forgot to write the Hello World, the first person that begin this tradition was a crack.
mmmm, I am from Venezuela, for a lot of time I leave beside the coding, I was so focus in work that I forgot how fun was to code... I moved to Brasil six mothns ago and I start again my life there. baby steps first learn a new language, leave the fear and be brave, leave my family behind and right now I'm trying to recuperate the time learning to code again.
I recive a lot of surprises I knew good people, I win a scholarship in Platzi.com.br and the best of all, Never is to late to start again.
sorry if my english is so rusty I will checkout everything again.
